            <p>Device-specific support for the X-Touch One.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="body-copy">
            On the Behringer X-Touch One, MIDI Command Studio supports the motorized fader and LCD/scribble strip. The
            display can show the current preset, which is useful when switching presets from the controller. The fader
            can automatically move to match the target app’s volume when you switch to a preset where the fader is
            mapped to volume. This is useful when using the fader for volume control across different apps. You can
            effectively control multiple app volumes and the system volume with one fader.
